    Notes:

    * Makes a backup of the current save files before overwriting.
    * For time specifiers, the time of the original save is used, not the time
      of the backup.

    \b
    Backup specifiers:
      Index:
        The backup index, sorted from newest to oldest, e.g.
        "restore the save from x backups ago." 0 is the latest backup, 1 is the
        backup made before that, etc.
        Negative values can also be given; -1 would give you the oldest backup.
      Age:
        Minimum age of the save to restore, e.g "I want to go back in time by
        (at least) 1 hour." Amounts of time can be specified in 'HH:MM' format, or
        with a number followed by a unit.
        Examples: '1:30' (an hour and a half ago), '30m' (or '30 minutes'),
        '6h' (or '6 hours'), '9 hours, 15 minutes' (or '9:15'), '2d' (or '2 days')
      Date/Time:
        Maximum date/time of the save to restore, e.g., "I want to go back in
        time to 1:30 yesterday (or before)." Most date/time formats are supported.
        Examples: '16:30' or '4:30 PM' (today), '2021-01-20', 'August 3 2020'
      Filename:
        Either a full path or just the filename

    \b
    Examples:
      # Just restore the most recent backup
      ssc restore game1
      \b
      # Restore the backup made 2 backups ago (aka the 3rd most recent)
      ssc restore game1 -i 2
      \b
      # Restore a backup from (at least) an hour and a half ago
      ssc restore -a '1:30'
      \b
      # Restore a backup from (at least) 2 days ago
      ssc restore -a 2d
      \b
      # Restore a backup from 4:00 PM today or earlier
      ssc restore -d '4:00 PM'
      \b
      # Restore a backup from March 22 or earlier
      ssc restore -d 'Mar 22 2021'
